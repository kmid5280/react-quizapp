## Summary

This app is a React version of an earlier State Capital Quiz app which used jQuery. This app allows the user to test their knowledge of U.S. State Capitals via a ten-question quiz. It starts with a title screen, displaying on-screen instructions and a start button. Upon clicking the start button, the user must answer ten questions. After each question, a page will display that tells the user if they answered correctly or, if not, will display the correct answer. At the end of the quiz, a final score screen will display how many answers the user got correct. This page features a button that resets the quiz and allows the user to start over.

Recently updated to version 1.1, now using Redux!
